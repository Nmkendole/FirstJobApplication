@RestController
// @RestController is a REST-ful web service controller. that combines the functionality of both @Controller and @ResponseBody. --->@Controller â†’ Handles HTTP requests and returns a view name (like an HTML page).---> @ResponseBody â†’ Tells Spring to take the methodâ€™s return value and directly write it as JSON or XML in the HTTP response.
//@RequestMapping("/jobs")  // when @RequestMapping is applied at a class level it sets a base URL (/jobs....) path for all the methods that are handling requests in that particular controller
